## Profile
I'm an experienced remote `Java` and `Go` developer with a great passion for making small differences in this world. I'm most comfortable writing backend but I'm willing and able to work on anything in order to reach a goal. I also like to make remote work fun and friendly using the incredible power of `gifs` and old school textual humor.

## Experience

### [Datadog](http://datadoghq.com), Portland, April 2021 - present
- Story in the writing.

### [Fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com), Portland, October 2018 - March 2021
- Had fun contributing to the new Fitbit Data Warehouse running in [GCP](https://cloud.google.com) using Dataflow, Airflow, BigQuery, Data Catalog. 
- My proudest and more significant contribution was our access management slack app named _Sherlock Holmesboarding_. Sherlock integrated all of ldap (for getting managers), google groups (to review, add and remove access), Data Catalog (to list policy tags) and BigQuery (for inventory but also for archival of access requests) to make for a pretty nice and smile inducing experience to manage Data Warehouse access flows. 


### Traveling in USA and Canada, October 2017 - October 2018
- Spent 1 year on the road with the family in our VW Vanagon (aka Westy) and acquiring some world, less technical and slightly more social and mechanical experience.


### [Opower](https://www.opower.com), San Francisco/Portland 2012 - 2017
**Senior Software Engineer**, Data Services.

- This is the highlight of my career so far. I’ve made a lot of friends at `Opower` but I also gained confidence, skills and accomplished many things I’m proud of. More specifically:
	- Developed new energy storage model storing billions of usage reads per day with over 100 `TB` of data to enable the business to scale. Played an instrumental role in the design and implementation of the storage, ingest pipelines and services (`REST` apis). 
	- Lead simplification efforts of Opower's second generation meter read storage architecture and ingest pipeline reducing operational costs and improving data availability times from what was previously several hours down to minutes (at the rate of over `1.5 billion records/hour`).

### [OZ Communications](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/oz-communications)/[Nokia](http://www.nokia.com)​/[​Synchronica](http://www.synchronica.com)​ in a crazy ride of acquisitions, Montréal 2006-2012
**Java Software Developer**, ​Nokia Messaging Gateways serving more than 7M users worldwide.

- This feels like ages ago, before everyone had a smartphone. I worked on email and instant messaging gateways that were used by AT&T and Verizon (before smartphones made those obsolete). 

### [CGI Group Inc.](http://www.cgi.com/)​, Montréal 2004-2006
**Java Consultant**, ​Specialist for [Bell Canada](http://www.bell.ca/)​, Canada's largest telecommunications company, not that it matters.

- This was a fun first experience where I had the opportunity to design and implement the SSO security layer and order fulfillment of the relaunched [bell.ca](http://bell.ca).

## Education
### [University of Quebec](http://www.uqar.ca/)​, Rimouski, ​BSc Comp Sci (2004)

## Activities
### Open source
- I wrote and maintain a few slack-related projects including: 
  * [Step Curry](https://github.com/alexandre-normand/stepcurry): Step Curry takes Fitbit step challenges to slack by linking their Fitbit account and tracking steps  in a channel. I run and maintain a hosted version of Step Curry that can be installed via [this link](https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?client_id=818949993232.874011914615&scope=channels:read,chat:write,commands,users.profile:read,users:read,groups:read,im:read,mpim:read&user_scope=).
  * [Marco Poller](https://github.com/alexandre-normand/marcopoller): A simple slack polling app that can be self-hosted for enterprises having limitations on 3rd party apps. 
  * [Slackscot](https://github.com/alexandre-normand/slackscot): A slack bot framework with built-in support for threading, message updating and test-friendly plugin API. 
- [Glukit](https://mygluk.it): a `Go` project developed to attempt to mix behavioral science and diabetes management.

### Photography
- I like photography and I’ve gotten comfortable (code word for "good") enough to feel good about the results. If you’re into photography, check out my [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexnormand), [500px](https://500px.com/alexnormand)​ and [curated portfolio](http://photo.heyitsalex.net/).
