## Profile
I'm an experienced remote `Java` and `Go` developer with a great passion for making small differences in this world. I'm most comfortable writing backend but I'm willing and able to work on anything in order to reach a goal. I also like to make remote work fun and friendly using the incredible power of `gifs` and old school textual humor.

## Experience
### ![Vanagon](http://www.gowesty.com/images/vanagon-line2.png)
### Traveling in USA and Canada, 2017 - present
- I’ve been on the road with the family for the last 6 months or so traveling in our VW Vanagon (aka Westy) and acquiring some world, less technical and slightly more social and mechanical experience.

### [![pluggy](https://i.imgur.com/NIq4pSH.png)](http://opower.com/)
### San Francisco/Portland 2012 - 2017
**Software Engineer**, ​Data Services.

- This is the highlight of my career so far. I’ve made a lot of friends at `Opower` but I also gained confidence, skills and accomplished many things I’m proud of. More specifically:
	- Developed new energy storage model storing billions of usage reads per day with over 100 `TB` of data to enable the business to scale. Played an instrumental role in the design and implementation of the storage, ingest pipelines and services (`REST` apis). 
	- Lead simplification efforts of Opower's second generation meter read storage architecture and ingest pipeline reducing operational costs and improving data availability times from what was previously several hours down to minutes.
	- Developed operational command line tools in `Go` making it easy to download and use those (single binaries without dependencies readily built and hosted for non-developers). 

### [OZ Communications](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/oz-communications)/[Nokia](http://www.nokia.com)​/[​Synchronica](http://www.synchronica.com)​ in a crazy ride of acquisitions, Montréal 2006-2012
**Java Software Developer**, ​Nokia Messaging Gateways serving more than 7M users worldwide.

- Received an “Exceptional” performance review rating for positivism and volunteering to lead several challenging problem-solving efforts (2010). I think that means people acknowledged I did good work.
- Improved stability and performance of highly visible features such as push email notifications and `IMAP`/`POP3` mailbox polling.
- Reduced bugs and scalability issues by writing continuous functional test automation scripts and load test scripts.
- Responsible for the implementation of complex SMS interoperability using the SMPP protocol. This enabled easy and seamless communication between users of OZ’s messaging technology and user’s of any mobile phone.

### [CGI Group Inc.](http://www.cgi.com/)​, Montréal 2004-2006
**Java Consultant**, ​Specialist for [Bell Canada](http://www.bell.ca/)​, Canada's largest telecommunications company, not that it matters.

- It was a long time ago now but this was a fun first experience where I was given autonomy and responsibility designing and implementing the backend for the SSO security layer and order processing of the relaunched [bell.ca](http://bell.ca).

## Education
### [University of Quebec](http://www.uqar.ca/)​, Rimouski, ​BSc Comp Sci (2004)

## Activities
### Open source
- I'm most proud of [Glukit](https://mygluk.it), which I developed over the course of several months in my attempt to educate follow type 1 diabetics on the benefits of taking ownership and control over the disease. It's [written](https://github.com/alexandre-normand/glukit/) in `Go`, runs on the google app engine and includes a [OS X companion app]: [glukloader​](https://github.com/alexandre-normand/glukloader) written in `Swift`. ![glukit](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/961/39915912320_c97898ed67_z_d.jpg)

### Photography
- I like photography and I’ve gotten comfortable (code word for "good") enough to feel good about the results. If you’re into photography, check out my [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexnormand), [500px](https://500px.com/alexnormand)​ and [curated portfolio](http://photo.heyitsalex.net/).
